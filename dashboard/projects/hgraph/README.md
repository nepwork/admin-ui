# Hgraph

This library provides hypergraph services for nep.work, cosys.work and coplanetary.work nodes.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project hgraph` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project hgraph`.
> Note: Don't forget to add `--project hgraph` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file.

## Build

Run `ng build hgraph` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Publishing

After building your library with `ng build hgraph`, go to the dist folder `cd dist/hgraph` and run `npm publish`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test hgraph` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
